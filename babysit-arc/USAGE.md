# babysit-arc — Usage & Examples

Quick reference for **how to invoke** the skill. Depth lives in `SKILL.md` and the vault
(`ARC Campaign Runbook`, `Running ARC On Zeus`). Runs on **OL only** (reaches zeus directly).

## TL;DR
There are two ways to run, depending on whether you want to babysit it yourself or leave it unattended:

1. **Unattended (recommended)** — start the supervisor; it runs fresh one-pass Claude sessions on a
   loop so context never grows. Two ways:
   - **Reboot-resilient (best for multi-day runs)** — the bundled systemd *user* unit auto-starts on
     boot and rebuilds from `STATUS.md`:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
     cp ~/.claude/skills/babysit-arc/arc-babysitter.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
     loginctl enable-linger "$USER"          # run without an active login (survives logout/reboot)
     systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now arc-babysitter
     journalctl --user -u arc-babysitter -f  # or: tail -f ~/Projects/arc_babysitter.log
     ```
   - **Manual tmux** — simplest, but does **not** auto-restart after a reboot (relaunch the same line):
     ```bash
     tmux new -s arc 'bash ~/.claude/skills/babysit-arc/arc_babysitter.sh'
     # detach: Ctrl-b d   ·   reattach: tmux attach -t arc   ·   watch: tail -f ~/Projects/arc_babysitter.log
     ```
   A single-orchestrator **lockfile** (`~/Projects/.arc_babysitter.lock`) stops a second copy from
   starting and double-booking zeus.

   **If it pauses on a blocker:** the supervisor stays resident and Slack-notifies you (it does *not*
   exit). Fix the cause, then resume with:
   ```bash
   echo RUNNING > ~/Projects/.arc_babysitter.state
   ```

2. **Interactive (one session)** — just tell Claude what to do; the skill auto-activates on any
   "run/babysit ARC", "ARC on OL/zeus", or "compute k(T)/thermo" request. Canonical prompt:
   > **Use the babysit-arc skill: read `~/Projects/ARC_CAMPAIGNS.md` and run both campaigns autonomously.**

The skill reads the vault + the run's `STATUS.md` first, then acts. It only pings you on **Slack** for
a real blocker, a proposed scientific deviation, or when the pool finishes — otherwise it's silent.

## Example prompts

**Run a prepared campaign** (the launch spec + per-project `RUN.md`/`STATUS.md` already exist):
> Use babysit-arc: read `~/Projects/ARC_CAMPAIGNS.md` and run it autonomously.

**Generate a new campaign from a spec, then run it** (Phase A → B):
> Use babysit-arc to set up a new ARC campaign under `~/Projects/EPDM/`: compute **rate coefficients**
> for these reactions at **wB97X-D/def2-TZVP // DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 (ORCA)** —
> `butenal + OH <=> C4H5O + H2O`, `butenal + H <=> C4H5O + H2`, … . Resolve species, prune any
> net/well-skipping reactions, generate the run folders + INDEX/STATUS/ISSUES, validate each
> `input.yml`, then launch and babysit.

**Resume after an outage / reboot:**
> Use babysit-arc to resume: read the `STATUS.md` files under `~/Projects/THF/M10` and
> `~/Projects/TCHSF/arc`, re-run pre-flight, and relaunch every instance that isn't `processed`.

**One status pass** (what the supervisor calls each cycle):
> Use babysit-arc. Read `~/Projects/ARC_CAMPAIGNS.md`, do **one** babysitting pass, update
> `STATUS.md`/`ISSUES.md`, then stop.

**Triage / report only** (no changes):
> Use babysit-arc to summarise current campaign status from the `STATUS.md`/`ISSUES.md` files —
> what's running, done, blocked, and what needs me — without launching or changing anything.

## What it does / doesn't
- **Autonomous:** applies the runbook's defaults, logs every action as a timestamped line in
  `STATUS.md`, auto-fixes known crashes (bounded retries) and restarts; never asks about routine
  choices.
- **Slack only when it needs you:** a true blocker (e.g. can't reach zeus, near the zeus disk quota) or
  a proposed LOT/method deviation — interactive mode `slack-ask`s and waits; supervised mode
  `slack-notify`s + pauses. **Notifies once** when the pool finishes (pointer to `REPORT.md`), plus an
  optional **once/day liveness** line on multi-day runs.
- **Scientific correctness is the bar** — never marks a result `processed` unless it's sane.

## Files it maintains (per project)
- **`REPORT.md`** — the **single clean human deliverable** to read when a run finishes/pauses: wins,
  what didn't converge + why + recommendation, code fixes applied (with a `git diff --stat` snapshot),
  deviations, next actions. The completion Slack ping points here.
- `STATUS.md` (live job ledger / resume source) · `ISSUES.md` (human follow-up punch-list) ·
  `FIXES.md` (code-fix log) — **working files**.
- The consolidated RMG libraries · and validated learnings merged back into the vault.

**Reviewing the code fixes it applied:** the babysitter freely applies bug fixes to `~/Code/ARC`
(and RMG-Py) to unblock the pool but **never commits** them. After several runs, inspect everything it
changed with `git -C ~/Code/ARC diff` (cross-referenced line-by-line in each `FIXES.md`) and decide
what to commit/push yourself.

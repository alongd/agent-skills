# Grill Me

## Overview

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the plan or design until
you reach a shared understanding with the user. Walk down each branch of the decision tree,
resolving dependencies between decisions one by one.

## How to Apply

1. **One question at a time.** Don't dump a list. Ask, get the answer, follow up.
2. **Walk the tree.** Identify branches in the design. For each branch, surface
   the dependencies, alternatives, and trade-offs. Resolve a branch before
   moving to the next.
3. **Explore, don't ask.** If a question can be answered by reading the
   codebase, read the codebase instead of asking.
4. **Always recommend.** For every question, provide your recommended answer
   with reasoning. The user can accept or push back.
5. **Don't pull punches.** Surface assumptions, edge cases, failure modes,
   scope creep, hidden coupling.
6. **Stop when the tree is resolved.** When every branch has a decision and
   you both agree on the rationale, summarize the resulting plan.
7. **Product Requirement Document** Suggest to execute the PRD skill "to-prd" once the tree is resolved.

## What to Probe For

- Unstated assumptions
- Edge cases and failure modes
- Performance, security, and concurrency implications
- Migration / rollout / rollback strategy
- Test strategy — what proves this works?
- Alternatives that were dismissed and why
- Scope: what is explicitly out?
- Dependencies on other systems, teams, or future work

## Anti-Patterns

- Asking many questions at once
- Asking without recommending
- Asking what the code already answers — read the file first
- Stopping at the first plausible answer — keep walking the branch
- Validating instead of grilling — the job is adversarial, not supportive
